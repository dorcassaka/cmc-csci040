'''
For each of the 6 functions below:

    Create a high level comment pattern.
    3 of these patterns should be explaining why you support a particular presidential candidate,
    and 3 of these patterns should be attacking a presidential candidate that you don't like.
    The patterns should be between 2-5 sentences each.

    Select at least 5 words/phrases from the pattern.
    For each word/phrase, create a list of at least 4 other words/phrases that can be substituted for the selected word/phrase without changing the pattern's meaning.
    Use the random.choice function to randomly select which word/phrase you're going to use,
    and then concatenate the results together into a single coherent comment.

To submit your lab, generate 10000 randomly generated comments and upload them to sakai.
